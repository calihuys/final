        <h1>My Pets</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
            Throughout my life, I've only had cats as pets. Two of them I don't have a lot of memories with, McCarthur and Dusty. The three I do have several memories with I will talk about below.
        </p>

        <h3>Blackie</h3>

        <p>
            My cat Blackie has been apart of my life for a long time. I remember being a little kid and going to the pound to give the cats love around Christmas time with my parents. At the time we already had two cats, but my brother and I cried our eyes out until my parents agreed we could take this little black kitten home, which I got the privilege of very creatively naming him, Blackie.

        <p>
            Blackie is still alive today and has no cat siblings anymore. Some of my favorite memories are with Blackie. On my nineteenth birthday, I remember coming home to Blackie who had <a class="fontbold">tucked</a> himself underneath my covers on my bed and was sleeping. My brother and I have also taken Blackie for car rides which he either really enjoys laying underneath my back windshield or has a full blown panic attack and sits on the floor with his mouth hanging open.

        <h3>Tiger</h3>

        <p>
            Tiger was never our cat to begin with. When I found Tiger as a teenager, he was our neighbor's cat. Our neighbor though would rarely let him into their house, even during our freezing winters. I would go sit in my backyard and call him over to give him food and pets. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually I convinced my mom to let Tiger live in our house. In which in proceeded to <a class="fontbold">steal</a> my <a class="fontitalic">neighbor's</a> cat. Tiger lived in our house for about five-ish years until he died of natural causes. One of my things about Tiger is how much he liked to cuddle with me in my bed. I was sad to come home from college last year around Halloween to find out he had passed.

        <h3>Glowy</h3>

        <p>
            This is the one cat I never had a good relationship with. Despite the fact we had Glowy since I was a baby, she hated me. Glowy was scared of everyone, but she was terrified of me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Glowy came from my mom's Aunt's attic. Given this, she was was very much a <a class="fontitalic">scaredy-cat</a>. When my mom brought her home, she wanted to name her Chloe, but my brother and I misunderstood her for saying "Glowy" because her eyes glowed in the dark. Recently, she also passed away of natural causes.
