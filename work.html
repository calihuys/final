            This year, I was able to get a job working for the University of Missouri on Event Staff. As an Event Staff worker, I get to choose my schedule and experience sports events (and other campus events) while getting paid!
        </p>

        <h3>A list of events we can work include:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>SEC Football Games</li>
            <li>Concerts on Campus (sometimes off campus)</li>
            <li>Softball Games</li>
            <li>Basketball Games</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Although I have only worked a Chris Stapleton concert and SEC Football Saturdays, I've had a ton of fun. Gamedays with your friends can be fun, but when the game isn't predicted to be a <a class="fontitalic">good</a> one, why not work it and make money? 
        </p>

        <p>
            I also really enjoy working because of my friends that work with me sometimes. Bethany (mentioned on the friends page), is applying to for a job on Event Staff which is exciting! I met one of my co-workers, Garrett, and really enjoy working with him. At the Chris Stapleton concert, we both were working and got to watch the show while getting paid!
