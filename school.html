        <h1>My College Experience</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
            Originally, I wanted to attend the University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa, which I got accepted into. However, my dad forced me to take a tour Mizzou, in which I fell in love with the atmosphere.
        </p>

        <h3>Classes & Schoolwork</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes schoolwork can be overwhelming for me, especially this class. Coming to Mizzou with a year's worth of college credits from AP cources and dual enrollment has really been my savior. Each semester, I have been able to take around fifteen credit hours (which isn't too terrible) and still graduate within three years instead of four. 
        </p>

        <p>
            With COVID, classes have been more difficult to say the least. Being in STEM, since my major is Economics, a lot of difficult concepts pop up in my major classes. This semester, both of my major core classes are completely online with no scheduled meeting time. I'm a person who likes to ask questions because I usually don't understand everything fully. In total I have only had five in-person classes split between three semesters of classes. A lot of kids tend to like online school, but I do not. Based on my experiences here at Mizzou, in-person classes have been much easier to the grade in, especially due to the fact you can connect with your professors.

        <p>
            One of the things I have learned how to do (to an extent) is write computer code. The code for one of my previous assignments is:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <code>
                import turtle<br /><br />

                def draw_turtle(circles, radius, angle, turtleSpeed, turtleColor, turtleX, turtleY):<br />
                    thisTurtle=turtle.Turtle()<br />
                    thisTurtle.hideturtle()<br />
                    thisTurtle.color(turtleColor)<br />
                    thisTurtle.penup()<br />
                    thisTurtle.goto(turtleX, turtleY)<br />
                    thisTurtle.pendown()<br />
                    thisTurtle.speed(turtleSpeed)<br />
                    for x in range(circles):<br />
                        thisTurtle.circle(radius)<br />
                        thisTurtle.forward(5)<br />
                        thisTurtle.left(angle)<br /><br />
                

                turtle.Screen().bgcolor("white")<br /><br />

                NUM_CIRCLES = 120<br />
                RADIUS = 15<br />
                ANGLE = 3<br />
                ANIMATION_SPEED = 0<br /><br />

                draw_turtle(NUM_CIRCLES, RADIUS, ANGLE, ANIMATION_SPEED, "black", 0, 0)<br />
                draw_turtle(NUM_CIRCLES, RADIUS, ANGLE, ANIMATION_SPEED, "red", 200, 0)<br />
                draw_turtle(NUM_CIRCLES, RADIUS, ANGLE, ANIMATION_SPEED, "blue", -200, 0)<br />
                draw_turtle(NUM_CIRCLES, RADIUS, ANGLE, ANIMATION_SPEED, "yellow", -100, -110)<br />
                draw_turtle(NUM_CIRCLES, RADIUS, ANGLE, ANIMATION_SPEED, "green", 100, -110)<br /><br />
            </code>
        </div>
        <h3>Social Life</h3>

        <p>
            My first year on campus I honestly had no social life. With COVID and some personal issues I was having, it made it super difficult to go out and meet people. Without friends, it is kind of hard to have a really good social life. Second semester things started to get a little better for me, but not the greatest, still due to COVID. However, I did make some friends that ended up being good ones. Through some friends I had from home and my roommates, I was able to get out and connect with new people. By the end of the year last year, I felt like I my social life was improved.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the start of the school year this year, most of the friendships I made last year still existed. Usually I hangout with Bethany, mentioned on my friends page of this website, once a day. Even though COVID still exists, many more things are available to do now. We can go out to have a good time on the weekends and meet new people. Although there is a lot of negative things happening in the Greek life community which limits things to do, I don't feel like I'm missing out on the college experience everyone wants.
        </p>

        <h3>Campus</h3>

        <p>
            The campus here at Mizzou is so pretty. Sometimes walking across campus can be a pain because it is so spread out, but campus is beautiful in every season. I also feel like you get your exercise in for the day. When I lived in the Southwest Village dorms, my classes were so far away, but I got to get out and move my legs for a bit everyday or so. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The one complaint I do have about the Mizzou campus is how awful it can be walking during our intense winter weeks. I recall last year it was sleeting, freezing rain and I had a class on the north side of campus. My eyelashes had froze in the wind and by the time I got to sit down in class I could barely feel my toes.
